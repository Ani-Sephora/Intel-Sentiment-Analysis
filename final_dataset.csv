It can be more efficient I guess",3,"It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80¬∞C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors.",0

It's a beast nothing much to say",5,This processor is all-rounder for every tasks you do on PC from small to CPU intensive applications. If you are looking for vast performance with heavy production tasks this is very nice to have. Best to use with Motherboard DDR5 and PCI-E 5.0 supported motherboards.,1

This processor is a beast üî•",5,"I brought this processor for my gaming/workstation build .Combining this processor with nzxt 360 mm liquid cooling AIO , things went smoothly.It can handle literally all heavy tasks like 3d rendering , simulation , gaming , yet keeps temprature at 40c .Highly recommended for best gaming rigs .Note: 4th gen ssd is a plus for the build ... Otherwise there might be bottleneck with gen3 ssds while doing 3d rendering works .",1

Just bought it! and working great except the temperatures!!!",5,This is my best buy so far for gaming and editing. It runs great whatever you throw. Excellent performance so far. Cinebench score is 29000 at 125 TDP.Suggestion: Buy only if you have very good amount of cooler.,1
13th gen i7,"5.0 out of 5 stars
It's a beast for all kind of works",5,When compare to amd ryzen 7 7000 processors i5 14600k will easily beat in all aspects. But this will consume a lot of power and generate more heat. So we have to take atleast 700W with 80+ certified psu and a good liquid cooler. Any how As usually we can enjoy with this beast.,1

i9 14th gen is the beast!",5,"Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.My setup -MSI MPG z790 carbon wifiIntel i9 14900kMSI RTX 4070tiMSI MAG coreliquid liquid coolerSamsung 980 Pro - 1 TBRipjaws 32gb ddr5Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you. I got my wiring fixed in matter of minutes ona video call by their assistant.",1

It's just a overclocked i7 13700k",2,What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money,0

Best CPU for Budget Ballers.",5,"This processor is great mid to high range budget builds, if your looking for a cpu for around 10K INR, this is the perfect choice, it has 6 Cores and 12 Threads which is quite powerful. For me, pairing it with RX 6600 gave me around 120 FPS in almost all games while playing on High Graphics. About the stock cooler, the stock cooler can definitely keep the heat away, i experienced less than 60¬∞ while gaming, although u can go for a better cooler if u prefer that, but the stock cooler will do its job.Overall 9.5/10 product.",1

Highest Price to Performance processor for gaming.",5,"I upgrade from 9400f. The performance gain is a huge. I use cooler master hyper 212 with this and my cbinet have 3 intake 2 exhaust fan, Temp never cross 60¬∞c even when full load stress test. The efficiency of this processor is incredible runs below 1.2 volt. It never reach 1.2v even when doing Multi core stress test.If you're building mid range PC for gaming purpose this is the cpu you should consider. At this price point there's nothing that can beat this processor.",1

14th gen i5,No Title,No Rating,"Works just fine.  Looking back you can get pretty similar performance on a 13th gen and save like $30, or go up to the I7 which gives you two more performance cores.  It is working great though and cooler than the 14 gen I7 and I9.",1
